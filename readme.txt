My Client Wanted to build a game on Console. 
This game is called Bomber Man. 
This is a pretty famous game, in which User Moves on a board which contains hurdles and free places to move, in addition to Hidden Keys. 
User can Place Mine to break hurdles and find keys. 
Once all keys are found, player wins. 
And if User places a mine and user stays in adjacent places, mine blasts after some seconds and user dies.  
I Built whole game myself. User enters the dimension of the board. Then Board is generated using linked lists. 
User traverses and plays game.   Client was happy regarding this game. It was according to her requirements. less
